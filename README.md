# Random India Facts WhatsApp Sender

## Overview

While my partner was on a week-long business trip to India, I decided to write a script that sends him random facts about India. I created a Python script that sends automated WhatsApp messages. 
To accomplish this, I utilized the pywhatkit library and Windows Task Scheduler to automate the task.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.3
- Windows operating system (for Task Scheduler)

## Start

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a `secrets_.py` file with the `PHONE_NUMBER` variable containing the recipient's phone number you want to message.

Create a `filename_here.bat` file with the following:

```
@echo off
"path to your venv script\python.exe" "path to your app.py file"
pause
```

This `.bat` file we will use for our Task sheduler

## Set-up Task sheduler
Open Task sheduler

Create a new task.

Add the path to your `filename.bat` in argument

All that is left is adding a trigger, when do you want to run the script
